### Egg Fried Rice  ###
Price: 2
Difficulty: 1
Servings: 3

250g cooked brown basmati rice
6 spring onions
2.5 teaspoons Chilli jam
2 large eggs
150g firm silken tofu


  - Instructions :
  Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat.
  Trim and finely slice the spring onions and fry with 1 tablespoon of olive oil for 1 minute.
  Add the rice, chilli jam, a splash of water and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then toss for 2 minutes until everything is well coated.
  Push the rice to the sides of the pan, making a big well in the middle. Crack the eggs into the well, then use a rubber spatula to start gently moving the eggs around to create big curds.
  Break in the tofu, then fold the rice back through the egg until itâ€™s all looking good. Taste and season to perfection.
  Lightly oil the inside of a bowl, add the stir-fried rice, gently compacting it with the spatula, then proudly turn out on to a plate.
