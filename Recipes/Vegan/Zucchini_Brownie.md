### Zucchini Brownies ###
Price: 5
Difficulty: 5
Servings: 8
Prep time: 10 minutes
Cook time: 35 minutes

Dry ingredients:

- 3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sweetener
- 1 1/2 cups (135 g) rolled oats, ground into flour
- 1/2 cup (90 g) dairy-free chocolate chips (+ more for the top)
- 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp (50 g) cocoa powder (unsweetened)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/3 tsp salt
- 1 tsp instant coffee powder (optional)

Wet ingredients:

- 1 1/4 cups (200 g) shredded zucchini
- 1/2 cup (120 g) nut butter of choice
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) plant-based milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:

- Line a (15x23 cm) loaf pan or a slightly bigger pan with parchment paper or grease it with vegan butter or oil and preheat oven to 180°C. 
- Process all dry ingredients (except the chocolate chips) in a food processor.
- Add all wet ingredients and blend again until the batter is smooth.
- Finally, add the chocolate chips and stir with a spoon.
- Pour the batter into the loaf pan and add more chocolate chips on top.
- Bake in the oven for about 35-40 minutes. For fudgy brownies, I recommend a baking time of 35 minutes or less. And for cakey brownies, I recommend a baking time of 40 minutes or a little more. The baking time also depends on the size of the pan! You can insert a toothpick in the center of a brownie after 30 minutes and if it comes out clean/slightly crumbly the brownies are done. If the toothpick comes out very sticky/wet, then the brownies need more baking time.
- Let the brownies cool completely. They will firm up once they cool and taste even better on day two! Enjoy! Keep leftover zucchini brownies covered in the fridge. You can also freeze them!
